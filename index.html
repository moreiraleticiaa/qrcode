                    <h3>THE TEENAGER WHO INHERITED BILLIONS</h3>
                    <p>Avery Kylie Grams: a 17-year-old girl who received her inheritance from billionaire Tobias Hawthorne.</p>
                <p>On September 30, in a billionaire's mansion, Avery girl Kylie Grams inherited Tobias Hawthorne's entire fortune. And the most curious and confusing thing is that no one knows why this happened, since Grams is a complete stranger to the entire family.</p>
                <p>After an individual goes to Avery's school and invites her to a meeting with the entire Hawthorne family, the girl discovers that an elderly man had put her in his will. When she arrived at Tobias's mansion, she realized that she had inherited all of Mr. Hawthorne's money.</p>
                <p>We managed to talk to some family members and they told us that they were surprised that the stranger had won the entire inheritance, some of them even got quite angry while they explained the situation to us.</p>
                <p>Others claim that Tobias Hawthorne was a man full of secrets and who loved thought-provoking mysteries, making coexistence between the family in the house worse than for others.</p>
                <p>As the case is recent, we haven't gotten much information yet, but we believe this news will yield a lot of stories. Follow our newspaper so you don't miss any news that comes out and receive everything firsthand.</p>
